Known Issues
----------------------------------
* The turns are implemented correctly in the code, but the GUI can't refresh to show the proper number of turns
* The image also never refreshes. I can change the "File" the image is taken from, but the new image is never shown.
* Since turns aren't implented fully, I haven't implemented an "End Game" scenario. Shouldn't be too difficult considering the levels are implemented correctly and you could just compare levels to what they should be.
* Scaling isn't done great. Resizing the widets makes certain parts of the GUI look awkward.
* Options not implemented
* Tips is currently just a static place holder
