Soil Time!
================

This program is a simple prototype for an educational game. Hopefully it can be added to by other developers.


Dependencies
----------------
* intltool
* gtk3-devel (Fedora) or libgtk-3-dev (Ubuntu)
* glib
* gtk3

Known Issues
----------------------------------
* The turns are implemented correctly in the code, but the GUI can't refresh to show the proper number of turns
* The image also never refreshes. I can change the "File" the image is taken from, but the new image is never shown.
* Since turns aren't implented fully, I haven't implemented an "End Game" scenario. Shouldn't be too difficult considering the levels are implemented correctly and you could just compare levels to what they should be.
* Tips is currently just a static place holder.
* The educational aspects are not be correct. I don't have much knowledge in this field. The plants currently affect random levels (ie Alder changes carbon levels). Having a professional in this field to compare notes with.
* Scaling isn't done great. Resizing the widets makes certain parts of the GUI look awkward.
* Options not implemented
